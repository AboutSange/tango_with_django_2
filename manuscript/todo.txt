 Any URL string supplied by the user that matches this pattern means that the view `views.index()` will be invoked by Django. You might be thinking that matching a blank URL is pretty pointless - what use would it serve? Remember that when the URL pattern matching takes place, only a portion of the original URL string is considered. This is because Django will first process the URL patterns in the project processing the original URL string (i.e. `rango/`) and strip away the `rango/` part. Django will then pass on an empty string to the Rango app to handle via the URL patterns in `rango/urls.py`. 
The next parameter passed to the `url()` function is the `index` view, which will handle the incoming requests, followed by the optional parameter, `name` that is set to a string `'index'`.
